      <p class="govuk-body-l">This service allows private limited companies to confirm that company information is correct and file a confirmation statement (previously known as an annual return).</p>
      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">You can only use this service if the company:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>is a private limited company</li>
        <li>has only one officer</li>
        <li>has only one shareholder</li>
        <li>has one person with significant control (PSC), or no PSCs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If the company does not meet these criteria, you will need to file a confirmation statement using our
        <a href="https://ewf.companieshouse.gov.uk//seclogin?tc=1">WebFiling service</a>.</p>

      <p>You cannot use this service to make any changes to company information. You should
        <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/?_ga=2.234418846.1677422186.1609766992-866947589.1602497498">check the company's details</a>
        and update any information that is incorrect or out of date before filing the confirmation statement.

        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">To file a confirmation statement, you'll need:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>a Companies House account, which is different from a WebFiling account</li>
          <li>the company number</li>
          <li>the company authentication code</li>
          <li>to pay the £13 annual fee using a credit or debit card</li>
        </ul>

        {{ govukInsetText({
          html: insetHTML

<p>It can take up to 15 minutes to file a confirmation statement. The service will time out after 60 minutes and your answers will not be saved.</p>
